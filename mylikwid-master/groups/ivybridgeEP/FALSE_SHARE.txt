Formula:
Local LLC false sharing [MByte] = 1.E-06*MEM_LOAD_UOPS_LLC_HIT_RETIRED_XSNP_HITM*64
Local LLC false sharing rate = MEM_LOAD_UOPS_LLC_HIT_RETIRED_XSNP_HITM/MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED_ALL
Remote LLC false sharing [MByte] = 1.E-06*MEM_LOAD_UOPS_LLC_MISS_RETIRED_REMOTE_HITM*64
Remote LLC false sharing rate = MEM_LOAD_UOPS_LLC_MISS_RETIRED_REMOTE_HITM/MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED_ALL
-
False-sharing of cache lines can dramatically reduce the performance of an
application. This performance group measures the L3 traffic induced by false-sharing.
The false-sharing rate uses all memory loads as reference.
For systems with multiple CPU sockets, this performance group also measures the
false-sharing of cache lines over socket boundaries.
