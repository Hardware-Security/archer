Branch misprediction rate  PMC2/PMC0
Branch misprediction ratio  PMC2/PMC1
Instructions per branch  PMC0/PMC1

Formulas:
Branch rate = RETIRED_BRANCH_INSTR/RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
Branch misprediction rate = RETIRED_MISPREDICTED_BRANCH_INSTR/RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS
Branch misprediction ratio = RETIRED_MISPREDICTED_BRANCH_INSTR/RETIRED_BRANCH_INSTR
Instructions per branch = RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS/RETIRED_BRANCH_INSTR
-
The rates state how often on average a branch or a mispredicted branch occurred
per instruction retired in total. The branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
Instructions per branch is 1/branch rate.
