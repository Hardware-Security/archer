Formulas:
L2 request rate = L2_REQUESTS_ALL/INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED
L2 miss rate  = L2_MISSES_ALL/INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED
L2 miss ratio = L2_MISSES_ALL/L2_REQUESTS_ALL

This group measures the locality of your data accesses with regard to the L2
Cache. L2 request rate tells you how data intensive your code is or how many
data accesses you have on average per instruction.  The L2 miss rate gives a
measure how often it was necessary to get cache lines from memory. And finally
L2 miss ratio tells you how many of your memory references required a cache line
to be loaded from a higher level.  While the# data cache miss rate might be
given by your algorithm you should try to get data cache miss ratio as low as
possible by increasing your cache reuse.  This group is inspired from the
whitepaper -Basic Performance Measurements for AMD Athlon 64, AMD Opteron and
AMD Phenom Processors- from Paul J. Drongowski.
