Pairing ratio PMC1/(PMC0-PMC1)

Formulas:
V-pipe ratio = VPU_INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED_V_PIPE/VPU_INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED
Pairing ratio = VPU_INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED_V_PIPE/(VPU_INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED-VPU_INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED_V_PIPE)
--
This performance group measures the pairing ratio of vector instructions. The
V-pipe can only execute a subset of all instruction, the main workload is done
by the U-pipe. A higher throughput can be achieved if the pairing ratio is
increased.
