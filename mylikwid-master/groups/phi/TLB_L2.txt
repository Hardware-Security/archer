-
This performance group measures the L2 TLB misses. A L2 TLB miss has a penelty
of at least 100 cycles, hence it is important to avoid them. A high ratio can
indicate trashing because when multiple pages are accessed in a loop iteration,
the size and associativity is not sufficient to hold all pages. This would also
result in a bad ratio for the L1 TLB.
