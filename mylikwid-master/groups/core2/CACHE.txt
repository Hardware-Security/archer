Formulas:
data cache request rate =  L1D_ALL_REF / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
data cache miss rate = L1D_REPL / INSTR_RETIRED_ANY
data cache miss ratio =  L1D_REPL / L1D_ALL_REF
-
This group measures the locality of your data accesses with regard to the
L1 cache. Data cache request rate tells you how data intensive your code is
or how many data accesses you have on average per instruction.
The data cache miss rate gives a measure how often it was necessary to get
cache lines from higher levels of the memory hierarchy. And finally
data cache miss ratio tells you how many of your memory references required
a cache line to be loaded from a higher level. While the# data cache miss rate
might be given by your algorithm you should try to get data cache miss ratio
as low as possible by increasing your cache reuse.
