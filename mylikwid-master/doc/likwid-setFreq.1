.SH DESCRIPTION
.B likwid-setFreq
is a command line application that mediates the request from
.B likwid-setFrequencies(1)
because setting a CPU core's frequency and/or governor requires root privileges. This executable must be suid-root.
.B likwid-setFreq
works only with the kernel module acpi-cpufreq. The recent intel_pstate module does not allow to set fixed frequencies.
