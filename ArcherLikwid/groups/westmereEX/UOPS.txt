Formula:
Issued UOPs = UOPS_ISSUED_ANY
Merged UOPs = UOPS_ISSUED_FUSED
Retired UOPs = UOPS_RETIRED_ANY
-
This group returns information about the instruction pipeline. It measures the
issued, executed and retired uOPs and returns the number of uOPs which were issued
but not executed as well as the number of uOPs which were executed but never retired.
The executed but not retired uOPs commonly come from speculatively executed branches.
