Formulas:
V-pipe ratio = INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED_V_PIPE/INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED
Pairing ratio = INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED_V_PIPE/(INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED-INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED_V_PIPE)

Each hardware thread on the Xeon Phi can execute two instruction simultaneously,
one in the U-pipe and one in the V-pipe. But this is only possible if the
instructions can be paired. The instructions executed in paired fashion are counted
by the event INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED_V_PIPE. The event INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED increments
for each instruction, hence the maximal increase per cycle can be 2.
