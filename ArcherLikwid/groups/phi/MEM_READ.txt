METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
Memory read bandwidth [MBytes/s] 1.0E-06*(PMC0+PMC1)*64.0/time
Memory read data volume [GBytes] 1.0E-09*(PMC0+PMC1)*64.0

Formulas:
Memory read bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*(L2_DATA_READ_MISS_MEM_FILL+HWP_L2MISS)*64.0/time
Memory read data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*(L2_DATA_READ_MISS_MEM_FILL+HWP_L2MISS)*64.0
-
Bandwidth and data volume of read operations from the memory to L2 cache. The
metric is introduced in the book 'Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor High-Performance
Programming' by James Jeffers and James Reinders.
