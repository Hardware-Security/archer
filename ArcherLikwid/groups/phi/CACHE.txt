These metric is a way to measure the computational density of an
application, or how many computations it is performing on average for each
piece of data loaded. L1 compute to data access ratio should be
used to judge suitability of an application for running on the Intel MIC
architecture. Applications that will perform well on the Intel MIC
architecture should be vectorized, and ideally be able to perform multiple
operations on the same pieces of data (or same cache lines).
