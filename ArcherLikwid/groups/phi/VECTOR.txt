Formula:
Vectorization intensity = VPU_ELEMENTS_ACTIVE / VPU_INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED

Vector instructions include instructions that perform floating-point
operations, instructions that load vector registers from memory and store them
to memory, instructions to manipulate vector mask registers, and other special
purpose instructions such as vector shuffle.
According to the book 'Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor High-Performance Programming'
by James Jeffers and James Reinders, the vectorization intensity should be >=8
for double precision and >=16 for single precision.
