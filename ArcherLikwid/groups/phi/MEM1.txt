Formulas:
L2 RFO bandwidth [MBytes/s] = 1.0E-06*L2_DATA_WRITE_MISS_MEM_FILL*64.0/time
L2 RFO data volume [GBytes] = 1.0E-09*L2_DATA_WRITE_MISS_MEM_FILL*64.0
-
Bandwidth and data volume fetched from memory due to a L2 data write miss. These
fetches are commonly called write-allocate loads or read-for-ownership (RFO).
