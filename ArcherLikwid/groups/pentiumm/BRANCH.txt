Branch misprediction ratio  PMC1/PMC0

LONG
Formulas:
Branch misprediction ratio = BR_MISSP_EXEC / BR_INST_EXEC
-
The rates state how often on average a branch or a mispredicted branch occurred
per instruction retired in total. The branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
