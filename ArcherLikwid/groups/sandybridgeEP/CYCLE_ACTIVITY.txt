METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
Runtime unhalted [s] FIXC1*inverseClock
Clock [MHz]  1.E-06*(FIXC1/FIXC2)/inverseClock
CPI  FIXC1/FIXC0
Cycles without execution [%] (PMC3/FIXC1)*100
Cycles without execution due to L1D [%] (PMC2/FIXC1)*100
Cycles without execution due to L2 [%] (PMC0/FIXC1)*100

LONG
Cycles without execution [%] = CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES_NO_EXECUTE/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE*100
Cycles with stalls due to L1D [%] = CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES_L1D_PENDING/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE*100
Cycles with stalls due to L2 [%] = CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES_L2_PENDING/CPU_CLK_UNHALTED_CORE*100
--
This performance group measures the cycles while waiting for data from the cache
and memory hierarchy.
CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES_NO_EXECUTE: Counts number of cycles nothing is executed on
any execution port.
CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES_L1D_PENDING: Cycles while L1 cache miss demand load is
outstanding.
CYCLE_ACTIVITY_CYCLES_L2_PENDING: Cycles while L2 cache miss demand load is
outstanding.
