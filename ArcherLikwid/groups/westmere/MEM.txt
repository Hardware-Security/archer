-
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
This group will be measured by one core per socket. The remote read BW tells
you if cache lines are transferred between sockets, meaning that cores access
data owned by a remote NUMA domain. The group also reports total data volume
transferred from main memory.
