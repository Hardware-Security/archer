METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
Runtime unhalted [s] FIXC1*inverseClock
Clock [MHz]  1.E-06*(FIXC1/FIXC2)/inverseClock
CPI  FIXC1/FIXC0
Ratio Port 1  PMC1/PMC0
Ratio Port 5  PMC2/PMC0

LONG
Formulas:
Ratio Port 1 = UOPS_EXECUTED_PORT1/UOPS_EXECUTED_PORT0
Ratio Port 5 = UOPS_EXECUTED_PORT5/UOPS_EXECUTED_PORT0
-
Measures how many instructions were scheduled on which issue port.
