== Filter scripts ==
A filter script is used by LIKWID to transform the output of likwid-perfctr and
likwid-topology from CSV (RFC 4180) to the desired format.

The filter scripts have to follow some rules to be integrated into LIKWID:
 - The name of the script must be equal to the resulting file suffix, e.g. xml
   for transformation to XML.
 - No output to stdout. All output to stdout is interpreted by the scripts as
   failure. If you want to print something use stderr.
 - A script must handle both likwid-perfctr and likwid-topology, the scripts
   call the script like this: <script> <input file> <perfctr|topology>

For implementing a new filter script written in Perl you can use the code
skeleton <SRC>/filters/template.
